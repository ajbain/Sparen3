# Sparen
## Welcome to Sparen!
This is an application built to mimic a banking application. In this application, there is the ability to create accounts and add transactions that are debits/credits. 
When you delete a transaction, it updates the balances accordingly for the bank account. If you add a transaction, you are able to see the transaction reflecting on the 
bank account's balance.

## General Info
This project is one of my first forages into MVC web application development. The timeline for this project was 2 and a half weeks, and I was responsible for everything from the 
wireframe design to the views for the pages. This was one of the first attempts into fullstack development. 

## Technologies:
.Net Framework C# \
WebMVC 

## Launch
Visual Studio Community 2019 Version 16.7.5 \
Microsoft .Net Framework Version 4.8.04084

## Examples Of Use
This is a simple CRUD database for banking information. An example of use would be to use as a checkbook or as a way to keep finances accountable. In order to use,
customer/user must first make an account. When they have made an account, they can migrate over to the "Transactions" tab, to add transactions. When transactions are added, 
they are classified as Debits or Credits that inherit from the transaction class. If a user puts in a transaction, and then they go to update, they can see the balance properly 
reflect in their account as well as on the transaction list. 

## Project Status
This project is still under development. I understand there are some bugs about how the index view of transactions are displayed.
